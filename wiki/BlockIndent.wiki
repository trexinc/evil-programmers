Indents the selected block (or the current line) to the nearest tab position or by space in the chosen direction (left or right).

Features:
  * Right or Left Indentation of the selected block (or the current line) by a tab or a space.
  * Each line in the block is indented relatively to its own position with no respect to other lines in the block.
  * Tab indentation as in Borland Turbo IDE, text is indented to the nearest tab position and not just by tab size.
  * Works correctly with any editor settings (expand tabs or not, inserts real tabs).
  * A menu with all plugin options is given for the user to create his/her/its own macros for the plugin functions (no internal far keys are processed).
