#summary How to build plugins
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Using Mingw GCC =

Read http://mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started and download *mingw-get*.

Then run:
  `mingw-get install gcc g++ mingw32-make mingw32-utils msys-core msys-m4 msys-bison msys-coreutils`

Don't forget to run *msys.bat* and from there:
  `/postinstall/pi.sh`

Don't forget to add *mingw\bin* and *mingw\msys\1.0\bin* to *%PATH%*.

From http://sourceforge.net/projects/re2c download: *re2c-0.13.5-bin.zip*
re2c-0.13.5-bin.zip needs to be extracted to *mingw/bin*

Now, to compile the plugins you need to use the following command:
  `mingw32-make -f makefile WIDE=1 COMMON=../path_to_common/from_far_svn`

Some plugins might require the CRT (*common/CRT*) lib from Far repository, it can be built as follows:
  `mingw32-make -f makefile_lib_gcc`
