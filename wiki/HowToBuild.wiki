#summary How to build plugins
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Using Mingw GCC =

Read http://mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started and download *mingw-get*.

Then run:
`mingw-get install gcc g++ mingw32-make mingw32-utils msys-core msys-m4 msys-bison msys-coreutils msys-diffutils msys-make`

Don't forget to run *msys.bat* and from there:
`/postinstall/pi.sh`

Don't forget to add *mingw\bin* and *mingw\msys\1.0\bin* to *%PATH%*.

From http://sourceforge.net/projects/re2c download: *re2c-0.13.5-bin.zip*
<br>re2c-0.13.5-bin.zip needs to be extracted to *mingw/bin*

Now, to compile the plugins you need to use the following command:
  `mingw32-make -f makefile COMMON=../path_to_common_from_far_svn`
some plugins might need:
  `mingw32-make -f makefile COMMON=../path_to_common_from_far_svn/unicode`
and some plugins might need:
  `mingw32-make -f makefile_gcc FARDEV=../path_to_far_svn_root`

Some plugins might require the CRT (*common/CRT*) lib from Far repository, it can be built as follows:
  `mingw32-make -f makefile_lib_gcc`

For x64 builds (not all plugins support it) use MingW64 from http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net (and msys from above) and add *DIRBIT=64* to all make commands.
