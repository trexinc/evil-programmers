How to view a picture file using the plugin:
--------------------------------------------
  This plug-in allows you to view images inside the window of FAR manager. It
will not work in full screen mode.

This plugin shows images automatically when they are opened in the Viewer or in
the Quick View panel. By default it works automatically only in Quick View but
can be set to work automatically in the Viewer too. Also by default file
extension is checked to see if it's an image before file data is checked, if
you want the plugin to check any type of file set the override option. All
options are available in the configuration dialog.

What can you do while viewing a picture:
----------------------------------------
1. Press the TAB key to switch focus to one of the elements of the view
   dialog - Image, Info.

2. When focus is on the image:
   a. Press Ctrl-R redraw the image.
   b. Any other key will be transfered to FAR, so +/- will go the next file
   when image is open in the viewer and Up/Down will go to the next file in
   panels and so on. When in viewer Space/BackSpace will act as +/-.
3. When focus is on the info line:
   a. Press +/- to view all the parts of a multi-page picture file. This feature
   is meant for multi-page tiff files and not for animated gifs.
