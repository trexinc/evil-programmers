v2.1 (21/12/08)
---------------

 + Far 2.0 build 677 support.
 * Changes in build system.

v2.0 (02/10/04)
---------------

 + The plugin can now indent  both  by  tab  and  single  space  as
   suggested and implemented by  Eugene  Sementsov  at  inbox.ru  /
   rels.
 * Note that menu hotkeys were changed, you might  need  to  update
   your macros.
 + Russian readme file thanks to Eugene  Sementsov  at  inbox.ru  /
   rels.
 * Rearranged folder structure.
 * Compiled using MingW with GCC 3.4.2.
 * Plugin size dropped from 4096 bytes to 3584 bytes.
 + Now the plugin is released under the GNU GPL license.

v1.11 (19/10/01)
----------------

 + If the current line is  outside  the  selected  block  then  the
   current line is indented and not the  selected  block.  I  think
   it's more convenient this way.
 * Plugin now checks for tab and space only as 0x09 0x20  (I  don't
   know of any code page where it's different) so it means a slight
   speed increase.
 * Some corrections to text files.
 * Now compiling with BCC 5.5.1 so plugin size  dropped  from  5632
   bytes to 4096 bytes.

v1.1 (04/09/01)

 + First public release.
 ! Some corrections to the code that might of caused some  problems
   as suggested by Ivan Sintyurin at mail.ru / spinoza.
 * Some cosmetic  changes  also  suggested  by  Ivan  Sintyurin  at
   mail.ru / spinoza.
