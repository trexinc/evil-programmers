Features:

  - Right or Left Indentation of the selected block (or the  current  line)  by
    a tab or a space.
  - Each line in the block is indented relatively to its own position  with  no
    respect to other lines in the block.
  - Tab indentation as in Borland Turbo IDE, text is indented  to  the  nearest
    tab position and not just by tab size.
  - Works correctly with any editor settings (expand tabs or not, inserts  real
    tabs).
  - A menu with all plugin options is given for the user to create  his/her/its
    own macros for the plugin functions (no internal far keys are processed).

Thanks go to:

Eugene Roshal and FAR Group - For FAR, the name that no  one  understands, that
                              means so much.
Ivan Sintyurin at mail.ru / spinoza - For all his plugins and  some  help  with
                                      this one.

P.S. In FAR v1.7 beta 3 build 591 this plugin  works  incorrectly  when  called
with overtype mode on (but who uses that anyway), this is corrected in the next
FAR release.
