         ! fixed

version 3.?? (??/??/??)
-----------------------
 ! By a funny coincidence HtmlHelp sub-plugin did not work  in  x86
   Far (with the fs redirection hook) running under x64 Windows.
 * HtmlHelp sub-plugin in some  case  was  not  working  well  with
   Conman (because of a problem in Conman or Windows).

version 3.02 (30/12/06)
-----------------------
 ! In some conditions the htmlhelp process was left running even so
   all help windows were closed. Fixed by Vadim Yegorov at bmg.lv /
   zg.

version 3.01 (14/05/05)
-----------------------
 ! Crash  in  Viewer.  Noticed  by  Tim  Sobolev  at   narod.ru   /
   tim-sobolev.
 ! "Show plug-in in Viewer" config option didn't work.

version 3.0 (14/05/05)
----------------------
 + New sub-plugin -  Custom.  You  can  pass  the  keyword  to  any
   external app and show its output  in  FAR's  viewer/editor.  For
   example to make it work with cygwin man write the  following  in
   the "Full name of the help file" field: man %k | col -b > "%o".
 + "Show plug-in in Viewer" config option.
 * "*. Current Topic (show menu)" will show all help files  in  the
   panels and only mask matched in the viewer. Suggested by  4ekucT
   at tut.by / 4ekucT.

version 2.9 (13/05/05)
----------------------
 + New ability of the CHMView sub-plugin. CHMViewFiltered - same as
   CHMView but  processes  the  HTML  output  through  an  external
   filter. By default it uses the zd2t filter that you can get here
   http://zmiy.by.ru/. Suggested by many people ;)
 * Reshow menu for Mueller  and  CHMView  only  if  an  appropriate
   option is set in the configuration dialog. Suggested  by  4ekucT
   at tut.by / 4ekucT.
 ! The HhtmlHelp sub-plugin should open correctly the wanted  topic
   more often.
 ! The "Input Keyword" dialog was  shown  sometimes  for  Activate.
   Noticed by 4ekucT at tut.by / 4ekucT.

version 2.8 (26/03/05)
----------------------
 * My home page has moved to http://trexinc.sf.net/.
 + New functionality of the Mueller and CHMView sub-plugins.  If  a
   topic selection menu was displayed  and  if  the  sub-plugin  is
   configured to open a topic in a modal  editor/viewer  then  when
   returning from that editor/viewer the  menu  will  be  displayed
   again. Suggested by johndoe at mail.zp.ua / johndoe.

version 2.7 (28/02/05)
----------------------
 + New command "*. Current Topic (show  menu)".  The  same  as  "?.
   Current Topic" but shows a menu of mask matched help topics  for
   the file currently opened in the editor. If only one  help  file
   is matched it's opened without showing  the  menu.  If  no  help
   files are  matched,  works  the  same  as  "?.  Current  Topic".
   Suggested by Eugene Sementsov at inbox.ru / rels.
 + New ability of the HtmlHelp sub-plugin. ExternalHTMLHelp  -  the
   same as HtmlHelp but uses an external application  to  open  the
   help files. It is configured by default for KeyHH which  can  be
   downloaded here http://keyworks.net/keyhh.htm. This should solve
   problems that may arise when working simultaneously with several
   opened HtmlHelp files.

version 2.6 (04/10/04)
----------------------
 * Some changes to registry  reading/writing.  You  should  recheck
   plugin's and sub-plugin's configuration and help file  settings.
   The changes should be only in checkboxes and numerical values.
 ! Non-english word boundaries could be wrongly identified.
 + New ability of the MS-Help2 sub-plugin, to  open  MS-Help2  help

   the current editor instance are used to  find  word  boundaries.

   Fixed by Sergei Wanin at nm.ru / v_i_l.

   accommodate large definitions (from 10KB to 64KB). Suggested  by
   Sergei Wanin at nm.ru / v_i_l.
 ! By mistake HtmlHelp windows  were  closed  while  unloading  the
   plugin or exiting FAR.

   quoted.

   will have to reconfigure it when first used.

version 2.3 (11/07/03)

   2002 or newer, etc.). You will need to download the H2Viewer app
   from http://helpware.net/mshelp2/h2viewer.htm to be able to  use
   this  plugin.  And  set  the  correct  path  for  this  app   in

   found.

   detect the default encoding for the type.

   windows maximized, minimized or normal.
