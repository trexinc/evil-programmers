   configure the plugin  if  you  want  to  use  non  english  case
   conversion.

   bytes to 8704 bytes.

version 2.11 (09/10/01)
-----------------------
 ! The plugin didn't work under Windows  NT/2000.  Thanks  to  Ivan
   Sintyurin at mail.ru / spinoza for noticing the problem.
 ! The action to be done in the menu did not coincide with what was
   really done. Thanks to Ivan Sintyurin at mail.ru / spinoza.
 + Added two letters to the russian + english table ô,õ and ö,÷  so
   I now consider the table as english + cyrillic.
 * Renamed the EditCase.dat to Cyrillic.dat
 + Added a Latin II case conversion table (LatinII.dat).
 * Some minor corrections and beautification to all text files.
 * Plugin size shrunk from 11264 bytes to 10240 bytes.

version 2.1 (28/09/01)
----------------------
 ! There was a serious bug that I created when  I  transformed  the
   original code from C++ to C, it didn't  cause  any  problems  in
   Case Conversion but generated some memory  leaks  and  incorrect
   operation of "Cycling change".
 ! Another bug that prevented correct work of "Cycling change" when
   only chars  above  ASCII  128  were  selected.  (I  hate  C/C++,
   assembler is much better :)
 * The "Cycling change" goes now lower->UPPER->Title as opposed  to
   the original lower->Title->UPPER to prevent words like "_foobar"
   to not cycle because "_foobar" is at the  same  time  lower  and
   Title case, because "_" has  undefined  case  but,  in  the  new
   cycling route it does not happen and in the  case  of  "_foobar"
   you get "_foobar"->"_FOOBAR"->"_foobar"->"_FOOBAR" and so on...
 * Changed the  "None/English  only"  string  to  "Standard/English
   only" and moved it to the *.lng files.
 * Some spelling/gramatic/cosmetic changes to !readme!.txt and  the
   *.lng files.
 +  More  undocumented  features  are   now   documented   in   the
   !readme!.txt file in the "Secret features (so, so)" section.
 * Changes to russian text in the file_id.diz as suggested by  Ivan
   Sintyurin at mail.ru / spinoza.

version 2.0 (21/09/01)
----------------------
 + Added support for  multiple  language  files  with  on  the  fly
   language file selection.
 * Extended the !readme!.txt, and made it more  understandable,  in
   my opinion :).

version 1.0 (19/09/01)
----------------------
 + Preliminary release with  only  one  language  file  at  a  time
   operation.
