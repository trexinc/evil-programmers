About
-----

This plugin is used to "visualize" otherwise not so easily  noticed  things  in
Far's internal editor - things like right border, tabs,  end  of  line,  cross,
etc.
To decide where the right border is this plugin uses another plugin called ESC.
ESC is an excellent creation by Ivan Sintyurin <spinoza@mail.ru>.
To get hold of your own copy of ESC visit:
