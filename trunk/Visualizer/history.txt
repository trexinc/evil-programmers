-----------------
 + Added support of [ESC] unicode version.

v0.5 (14/03/09)
---------------
 + Bookmarks visualization, from Drkns.
 ! In Far 2.0, dialogs could contain cut off text.

v0.4 (21/12/08)
---------------
 + Far 2.0 build 677 support.
 * Changes in build system.

v0.3 (25/11/08)
---------------
 + Option to draw a small cross.

v0.2 (29/03/06)
---------------
 + Added cross drawing.
 + Full configuration of everything.
 * Plugin can now work correctly without other coloring plugins.
 ! Could crash if there was less lines in the editor than on the
   screen.

v0.1 (28/03/06)
---------------
 + Visualize end of line.
 + Visualize tabulation.
 + Sources released under GPL.
 * Changed name to Visualizer (from VisualBorder) as the
   functionality has increased (still no configuration, I'm lazy).
 ! No longer crashes if [ESC] plugin is not found.
 ! Color is applied in the right position even when tabs are
   present but because it is only possible to color a tab symbol as
   a whole or just its starting location the right border marker
   will look a bit weird when a tab symbol crosses it.

v0.0 (27/03/06)
---------------
 + First version, doesn't really do that much.
