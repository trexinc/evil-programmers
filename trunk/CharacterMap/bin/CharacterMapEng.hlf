$ #About the plug-in#

  #Version: 3.21 , July 15 2006 , Sources included#
  Character Map (a.k.a ASCII Table) is a FAR 1.70 beta 5+ plug-in that shows
you a character map in which you can ~navigate~@Navigation@ to any character
and see its ASCII number and position. You can also perform any of the
available ~commands~@View@ that let you change the encoding of the
character table, insert the character to the current cursor position (in the
Editor or the Command line only) and/or copy it to the clipboard, but you can
do #more# than that, you can append characters to the input line at the
bottom of the plug-in's dialog so you can later insert and/or copy the whole
bunch instead of doing so one character at a time. This plug-in also supports
insertion of the #NULL# character to the editor, have you ever saw it before?
You can ~configure~@Configure@ the plug-in to select or not the character under
cursor in the Editor and/or the command line, to automatically copy the text
to the clipboard and to determine how it will encode the inserted/copied text.
And other little conveniences.
  And starting with version 3.0 this plug-in allows you to ~create~@Edit@ your
own or ~edit~@Edit@ existing character tables and save them in REG format so
you will be able to install and/or distribute them.

  Use the arrow keys to move around.
  Pressing Left/Right when the cursor is at the most left/right position will
move the cursor to the end/beginning of the line above/below.

  Left clicking on any character will move the cursor to it.

  #Any character with ASCII code above 31#
  Pressing any character with ASCII code above 31 will move the cursor to the
position corresponding to that character's OEM ASCII code and that is not
necessarily the position of that character in the current table.
  #Note:# This can also be achieved by pressing Alt-XXX where XXX is any
number between 32-255, the numbers should be pressed on the Numpad.

  #PgUp#
  Go to the top of the column.

  #PgDn#
  Go to the bottom of the column.

  #Home#
  Go to the start of the line.

@View
$ #Operating with tables#

  While viewing a table you can use the following commands:

  #Alt-Shift-F9#
  Opens the ~Configuration~@Configure@ dialog.

  #Shift-F8# or #Left Click on the code page name#
  Shows you the encoding table selection menu.

  #F8# or #Right Click on the code page name#
  Switches between Windows (ANSI) and DOS (OEM) encodings.

  #F9#/#Shift-F9#
  Cycle forward/backward through the encoding tables.

  #Note:# Changing tables is available only when the edit control is empty.

  #Ctrl-I#
  Opens a dialog with some info on the current table.

  #Enter# or #Double Left Click on any character#
  Along with what is described below the text/char will be processed according
to the options set in plug-in's configuration menu. (See ~Configuration.~@Configure@)
  When the Edit Control is #empty#:
    #In Viewer#: Close.
    #In Panels#: Insert the character under cursor to the current position in
the command line and close.
If the character is NULL (0) then nothing will happen.
    #In Editor#: Insert the character under cursor to the current position in
the editor.
Can fully handle any character including NULL (0).
  When the Edit Control is #not empty#:
    #In Viewer#: Close.
    #In Panels#: Insert the string inside the edit control to the current
position in the command line and close.
    #In Editor#: Insert the string inside the edit control to the current
position in the editor and close.

  #Shift-Enter# or #Insert# or #Right Click on any character#
  Appends the character under cursor to the text in the input line at the
bottom of the dialog.
  #Note 1:# NULL (0) can only be added to the text if the plug-in was opened
from the Editor or Viewer.
  #Note 2:# The maximum number of characters you can append is 511.

  #Add (Numpad Plus)#
  Will perform the same action as Shift-Enter with addition of moving the
cursor one position to the right in the character map, that means that it can
move over lines too, more extensively about the moving process
~here~@Navigation@.

  #Subtract (Numpad Minus)#
  Will perform the same action as Shift-Enter with addition of moving the
cursor one position to the left in the character map, that means that it can
move over lines too, more extensively about the moving process
~here~@Navigation@.

  #Del# or #Right Click on the edit control#
  Clear (erase) the whole text in the edit control.

  #Backspace# or #Left Click on the edit control#
  Erase one character from the end of the text in the edit control.

  #Ctrl-C# or #Ctrl-Insert#

@Edit
$ #Creating/editing tables#

  You can start the editing mode in two ways:
  1. #Ctrl-N# - Creates a new encoding table (based on DOS (OEM)).
You will be asked to fill the needed information such as table name and so on.
  2. #Ctrl-E# - Lets you edit the table currently selected.

  After you have entered the editing mode you might have noticed that the
appearance of the plug-in has changed.
  In the middle (below the main character map) you should see a small input
line with a text on the right of it explaining its contents. In this input
line will be shown your input for the currently selected character. The type
of the allowed input is what the text on the right of input line says. To
change the type of the input just press #Ctrl-E# until you reach the wanted
type. The available types are hex, decimal and character. Where hex is any hex
number between 00 and FF, decimal is any number between 000 and 255, and
character is any character (above space 0x20) which you can enter on the
keyboard.
  On the right you should see a look-up table for characters in the DOS (OEM)
encoding put there to assist you in your character table editing task.
  In the bottom you should see a list-box where you can load some file, by
pressing #Ctrl-L#. The loaded file will be decoded using the current table and
any change to the table will be immediately reflected upon the loaded file so
you can see how your table works in real-time. To unload a file from the
list-box press #Ctrl-U#.

  To edit the name of the table and some additional information press #Ctrl-I#
and you will be shown a dialog allowing you to set the wanted field.

  To save the current table to a REG file press #Ctrl-S# and enter the wanted
filename when asked.

  To quit editing mode press #Ctrl-X#.

  Pressing #Alt-Shift-F9# will open the ~Configuration~@Configure@ dialog.

@Configure
$ #Configuration#

  #Select char under cursor in Editor#
  Position the cursor inside the character map to the current character under
cursor in the editor, if any. (When plug-in is opened from the editor)

  #Select char under cursor in Command Line#
  Position the cursor inside the character map to the current character under
cursor in the command line, if any. (When plug-in is opened from the panels)

  #Copy text to clipboard on close#
  After closing plug-in's dialog with Enter or similar the character under
cursor (if the edit control is empty) or the text in the edit control (if it's
not empty) will be copied to the windows clipboard along with any other action
the Enter is supposed to do.

  #Encode text to current FAR table#
  If this option is on, the text will be inserted/copied to wherever it needs
to be inserted/copied exactly as you see it on the screen. But if this option
is off then the text will be inserted in the currently selected encoding
within the plug-in.
