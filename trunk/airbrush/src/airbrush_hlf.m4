@Syntax
$  #Air Brush - syntax file description#

  #Syntax# file consists of several sections.
  Each section starts with a line of the form:

  #file# description mask [file start]

  Each section consists of several contexts.
  Each context starts with a line of the form:

  #context# [#exclusive#] [#whole#|#wholeright#|#wholeleft#] [#linestart#] delimiter [#linestart#] delimiter [foreground] [background]

  One exception is the first context. It must start with the command:

  #context# #default# [foreground] [background]

  The #linestart# option dictates that delimiter must start
  at the beginning of a line.

  The whole option tells that delim must be a whole word. What
  constitutes a whole word are a set of characters that can be
  changed at any point in the file with the wholechars command.
  To specify that a word must be whole on the left only, you can
  use the wholeleft option, and similarly on the right. The left
  and right set of characters can be set seperately with:

  #wholechars# [#left#|#right#] characters

  The #exclusive# option causes the text between the delimiters to
  be highlighted, but not the delimiters themselves.

  Each context may contain rules.
  Each rule is a line of the form:

  #keyword# [#whole#|#wholeright#|#wholeleft#] [#linestart#] [#recursive#] string [foreground] [background]

  Comment may be included on a line of there own and begin with a ##.

  Another file may be included:

  #include# filename

  Special sequences:

  #\n# - line feed.
  #\r# - cariage return.
  #\t# - tab.
  #\s# - space.
  #*#  - any symbol except #\n#.
  #+#  - any symbol except #\n#, #\t# and #\s#.

  Also you can use character sets.
  Set definition must be between #/# symbols.
  Character sets examples:
  #/[a-zA-Z]+/#
  #/[0-9]?/#
  #/[\040-\377]*/#
  #/[0-9]{1,5}/#
  #/[-,\[\]]{1,}/#
